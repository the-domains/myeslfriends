And so, we begin.  I am George Machlan and I hope to become a friend of yours.  We are all on a journey through this life.  The journey can feel so overwhelming at times.  Must we walk alone through this?  Is there a better way?

I am satisfied that there is only one way to successfully navigate this life.  And that way is with the person-God named Jesus Christ.  If you are looking for some company during your stay on planet Earth, why don't you join me and some friends?  We hold ourselves to a promise to first build each other up.  Secondly, we constantly remind each other of the "big picture" which is the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  And finally to do whatever it takes to ensure none are left behind.

We are just getting started but invite you to join in a daily conference call.  6:30 AM Local time New York  (11:30AM GMT) If you have a headset on your internet enabled computer go to this link: Join the call: https://www.uberconference.com/myeslfriends
